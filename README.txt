                                                             Project "Learn Tech"

The project is designed with the help of HTML and CSS.In this way it makes the developers understand the product easier.
We started the project with the opening of the html and head .
Then we proceeded with the linking of the html document with the design document (css file).
Then we started with the design of logo and inserted it with the body of our page.
Once the logo is been inserted we opened a table with links to 1)Our Courses
                                                               2)Home Page
